            A system for the storage, cataloguing and retrieval of documents, media assets and other files.
This application is a prototype and proof-of-concept for Morten Skjeggestad. Morten wants a custom
application that allows his creative staff to store and share multimedia assets on a cloud repository.
His staff need a user-friendly application that lets them upload and store different types of media files.
They need to be able to attach metadata such as title, author, date and a keywords or tags to each item
as it is uploaded. Users should be able to search for items using the metadata fields. The result of a
search should be to display a list of files and their associated metadata. The staff should also be able
to communicate via a chatting system
